This system is meant to emulate an \[n\]-agent textual stream enviroment, where many clients are sending content at once. These streaming "agents" send streamed messages to a message broker, containing metadata information about their content:

```json
{
    "agent_id": "Agent_Lauren",
    "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:24:59.753053",
    "destination_uri": "/ever.md",
    "chunk" : "To be, or "
}
```

```json
{
    "agent_id": "Agent_Lauren",
    "timestamp": "2025-02-25T10:24:59.753578",
    "destination_uri": "/ever.md",
    "chunk" : "not to be"
}
```

>>Each message represents an immutable "transaction" to a virtual filesystem, that in addition to being lazily loaded through timestamp serialization, can be version controlled via the timestamp as well. Our percieved value in the system is a theoretical ability to store and organize the data from many agent streams in parallel.
